General comment:
All electrical components can be repaired in-situ. This is assuming that the repair is possible considering the limitations below: 
1. Limitation due to access and size of the hatches and size of the modules to be repaired.
2. Movement of WEC
3. Commissioning/partial commissioning or testing offshore after repair or replacement of parts.
Please clarify.
For the failure that requires replacement of the whole module, would a dry dock repair required due to the limitations mentioned above?
Also see risk ID 0330-1 for comment on occurrence class","The speed rating for the machine is 150% higher than extreme seas freewheeling worst case real seas simulation.  In the case of speed being higher than set point of 100% speed (~15rpm) M2G MoMo controller can disconnect and allow freewheeling.  While freewheeling, all power electronics are isolated from higher voltage potentials. The MoMos are 4-quadrant controllers, which motor or generate in either direction. An error in controller could cause issue with direction, but M2G control diagnostics would quickly alarm and fault out.  Mechanically designed to either motor or generate at any given time. "

Marine cast resin transformers (CRT) are certified for marine and offshore applications by DNV GL, ABS etc. all over the world.  How does the rated corrosion resistance relate to the FLS? Seems the FLS would relate to the mounting hardware etc. and not to the electrical properties of the transformer performing its function.  This is not a higher occurrence since it's application same as other marine transformers.  Do other marine transformers have a high rate of corrosion induced failure? A high failure rate would be bad for the marine transformer industry. The mounting technique will be put under FLS scrutiny"
