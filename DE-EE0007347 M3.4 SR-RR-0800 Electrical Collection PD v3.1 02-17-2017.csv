2) ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Corrosion could lead to two failure modes, either a mechanical failure due to loss of strength or an electrical fault. These should be divided into separate risks. This is a high risk for long term deployment due to energetic motions that make it difficult to  protect against water ingress especially at connection points. However a short term deployment is a good opportunity to test the system and check for potential signs of wear/water ingress.","All mechanical failure will lead to an electrical fault
The umbilical should be design to last one lifetime. 20yar minimal on 3signma, 7 occurrence is 32 years.  It seems the resultant risk should be not high.  Design target is medium which is possibly impossible and financially irresponsible to achieve.
